			Bangkok is the capital city of Thailand and has a population of over 10 million people. It is one of the world's top tourist destinations and has been named the world's most-visited city numerous times.
			Its name in Thai has 168 letters, but locals usually refer to Bangkok as Krung Thep, which roughly translates to 'City of Angels'. With a wide variety of activities and attractions, from traditional markets and exquisite temples to rooftop bars and modern luxury malls, there is something for everybody in Bangkok!
